2. List of commands
getcourses: echo, exit, grep, sed, sort
perform-measurement.sh: echo, exit, mktemp, wget, wc, rm
run-analysis: echo, exit, read, grep

3. Explanation about decisions

getcourses: 
1) I decided to firstly find all the URL by using grep to extract the pattern "http://".
2) And then use "sed 's/regex/replacement/flag' " to add a slash sign after cse578
3) Also use "sed 's/regex/replacement/flag' to remove characters before 'http://' and 
replace characters 'csexxx/' with '21au/' "
4) remove url with 'csep', 'www', 'make4all', 'homes', 'mycse', 'drupal'
5) remove duplicate

perform-measurement:
1) use 'wget' to get the url info, and create a temporary file ('mktemp') to store it
2) use 'wc' to count the byte size of the html file
3) remove the temporary html file

run-analysis:
1) read the output file of 'getcourse' line by line using 'while read'
2) use 'grep -oE' to grep the regular expression 'cse[0-9]{3}' and only print out 
the matching part, assign this part to 'courseNum'
3) use preform-measurement.sh on url of each line and assign this part to 'pageSize'

4. Trends of the data and conclusion
Page size of most Webpage are between 0-50000 bytes, and only 2 webpage has readched 
over 10000 bytes. The maximum of the page size is around 22k bytes. I can come to the
conclusion that the page size the course webpage is not related to the course level.
Besides, no other solid conclusions can be drawn from this plot.

5. R scripts
20192.14 is printed out. "print(mean(mydata$V2))" is in the R script, so 20192.14 is 
the mean value of the page size.
